# Fact Generator

## Description

This is an application that generates a random fictional fact. I created this program as my *JavaScript Syntax Portfolio Project: **Mixed Messages***. The program showcases my knowledge of basic Javascript syntax as well as my ability to envision and build a program in my own coding environment. Hopefully those who use my program find it humorous on some level, or become wiser in understanding the mystries of the universe.

## Technologies Used

The project was created with:

>+ Javascript
>+ Node
>+ Visual Studio Code

## How to Run The Program

To run the program locally on your computer:

>1. Download and install node.js on your computer. Navigate to the following website to download node.js : "https://nodejs.org/en/download/"
>2. Download **script.js** on your computer.
>3. Use your preferred IDE to run script.js .

## Future Plans

My current knowlege in programming is limited to JavaScript. However, when I learn HTML and CSS, I plan on publishing my program online as an interactive website.
