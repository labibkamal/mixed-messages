# Surviving a Deathclaw

After establishing yet another settlement, The Lone Wanderer has been travelling day and night and day again to make his way back to Goodneighbour. The barren wasteland of Commonwealth has nothing that she has not bested before, and with her trusty companion Dogmeat by her side she feels ### . The scorching heat of the sun drains her stamina and she opens a cold Nuka-Cola. Another days journey lies ahead. 

Dogmeat suddenly starts to bark and jump around as if he senses danger. The ground rumbles and she senses the coming danger. But before she can start to prepare, a deathclaw emerges from the ground below and she helplessly falls to the ground. The deathclaw roars loud trembling the air, and rushes towards her. With no time to waste, she reaches for any weapon she can grasp.
